Library for push buttons (software debounce), Work in progress

A class for push buttons which is pretty debounce resistant. Idea after \href{https://hackaday.com/2015/12/10/embed-with-elliot-debounce-your-noisy-buttons-part-ii/}{\texttt{ https\+://hackaday.\+com/2015/12/10/embed-\/with-\/elliot-\/debounce-\/your-\/noisy-\/buttons-\/part-\/ii/}} form Elliot Williams.

For usage you have to call the update\+Button-\/\+Method regularly, I recommened a task scheduler. Examples will follow soon.

Check for button presses with is\+Pressed and is\+Long\+Pressed. The return value will give you if the button is pressed, the parameter only chooses if you want to execute the corresponding function for the button.
